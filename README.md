# Bluetooth 5 Specification Chinese Translation

This is most **stupid** way of trying to read through a specification of **2822** pages! Instead of trying to read it page by page in English, I am asking Google to translate it for me first, then I am trying to figure out how stupid  (smart) Google translation is (so you can expect corrected translations on the way). 

The initial commits for these chapters are mainly original Google spits, with some reorganization so it looks better as a Markdown document, with images cut from the original PDF document. So don't expect you can read it like real books as there will be something really stupid (if you consider the context). They might go through major corrections. But hey, Google spits them in no seconds!

# OK, do you have a more readable version?

If you really want to read the Chinese version, I bet you are Chinese! Then, go to my [简书](http://www.jianshu.com/u/5d207022e1f1 "CoryXie") pages! There are not many completed chapters right now, but hey, this is free time works! Also, even these pages may be updated regularly with minor corrections.

# Are you violating the law?

I don't know. I am just a poor programmer. Please do not sue me, I have a family to raise! Besides, I just want to do something good, but stupid.

# Any suggestions for translation?

Doing translation is hard, sometimes there are no suitable words in the target language (mostly due to the limitations of the translator). If you have suggestions for any translations, you can create issues, or comment on my [简书](http://www.jianshu.com/u/5d207022e1f1 "CoryXie") pages.
